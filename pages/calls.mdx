## Call notes:
Welcome to the latest Regen Learnings call, your monthly dose of fresh insights into public goods funding, Web3 innovations, and community-driven growth. Here’s what went down in our latest session, packed with updates, demos, and future plans.

1. Intro 
Kevin set the tone with a warm welcome, followed by Carl’s insightful data updates. Key highlights included:
    - Metrics for retro funding for Optimism.
    - Easy Retro Pgf used for funding rounds.
    - Collaborative efforts with Thrive and other ecosystem players to enhance cross-pollination of ideas.

2. Carl presented his recent work helping Optimism to use metrics for Retro Funding 4:
The big difference between the previous round and this new one is:  Instead of selecting projects directly, metrics will guide which projects receive support, so basically you can select the metrics you care the most and put them in your portfolio, combine them in your ballot and giving each a weight and see how those metrics apply to the project you are reviewing and supporting, and the script that will decide how to allocate the funding.
    - The round has completed the sign up phase::
    - Over 500 applications expected.
    - Both human and algorithmic checks to narrow down to 250 projects.
    - Voting on finalized metrics begins at the end of the month.

#### Testing App Demo 
    Users can now build a ballot by choosing metrics that matter most to them, giving more weight to trusted users’ preferences.
#### Community Updates 
    Community members shared their cool projects and updates, fostering a vibrant, collaborative atmosphere.
#### Data Model for Project Comparison 
    We’ve built a robust data model to clean and process data from six different blockchain chains, offering comprehensive project comparisons. An API endpoint now allows easy retrieval of project metrics.
#### Defining Custom Metrics & Trusted User Model 
    Users can create custom metrics, enhancing our data-driven approach. The trusted user model aggregates various trust signals to identify and give more influence to reliable users.

Also, Carl shared that they are exploring running Curation Algorithms 
We’re exploring algorithms like the IcanTrust to help users discover projects based on social connections. This approach promises a more personalized and effective way to find new and exciting projects.

    Question from Umar Khan:  How do you define trusted users?
    Carl:  Great question, there’s been a huge amount of feedback around it, there are 4 different trust signals that are being ingested:
        - Have a Farcaster ID of 20939.
        - Have a Gitcoin Passport of 20 points or higher.
        - Have a Karma3Labs EigenTrust GlobalRank in the top 50.000 of Farcaster users, or
        - Hold a soulbound NFT (in this particular case Optimist NFT) in their wallet.

For the sake of experimentation we are doing another Data Challenge, he was hoping to be able to announce just applying these kind of reputation models to the on-chain data, if anybody wants to experiment there will be some bounties available. We’ll post the link on the RegensLearnings channel once it comes out.


3. Thrive Protocol Overview:  Ben West from Thrive shared insights into Thrive Protocol’s mission to attract and reward top talent through structured grant programs:
    - Thrive Protocol works with ecosystems with relatively large grant or bounty programs to attract fund and scale top talent in the world at the Milestone of value creation.
    - Focus on “Trust but verify” to ensure effective use of funds.
    - Started working with the Arbitrum community, now we are starting to apply the same thinking with the Polygon community.
    - Partnership with Karma to improve impact assessment through human evaluators.

#### Decentralized Review Process.

Refining our review process to ensure fairness and efficiency:
    - Feedback loops and economic incentives for reviewers.
    - Two-tiered review system with randomization to maintain impartiality.
    - Aggregated feedback processed through AI for grantees.

At the moment, the whole process is being done in a spreadsheet, as they are testing out the methodology and concept behind what it is that they are doing, to get to a place where they are able to build this into a platform and do it in a scalable fashion.  Recently finished their stage gate review looking at the grants functionality, that will basically be what replaces these spreadsheets, and they may be able to use it with Polygon, who’s just came on board a few days ago.

    Carl asked: Are the reviewers, is that public information or is that kept private so that people don’t interfere with them?
    Ben: So, who the reviewers are overall is public, who’s reviewing which project is not, or what comment was derived by from them is not.  The intention is to avoid any kind of Shenanigans, like people bribing people, people attaching people.  Also we are not making the scores that one reviewer is giving public available to any other reviewers, this is somewhat different than the way we had been doing eligibility decisions at Gitcoin, where reviewers had a shared sheet and would actually have discussions and sort of shared learnings.  I think we’ll start integrating a phase after the initial scoring is done, where we’ll bring people together and have conversations about lessons learned or key takeaways, and get feedback about the process overall and discuss the decisions that are being made amongst everybody involved once the scores have come in, that is a step we didn’t do this time but we’ll have sort of end of the round wrap-up.

Ben invited to anyone who is willing to become a reviewer, they are always open to have more people involved, and if you have any feedback or comments about the process please share them in any of the governance forum posts at Gitcoin, Arbitrum or Polygon, we are really open to any critique and feedback.  Here goes a link where to [head](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/decentralized-review-process-summary-thank-arb-milestone-1b/24877).


4. Gitcoin Grants Round GG20 Data Analysis:  Arman’s analysis revealed a positive correlation between total donations and commit counts, highlighting the projects with strong community involvement. Future directions include expanding data analysis for deeper insights and trend identification.

Here is the link to his [work](https://github.com/sirlupinwatson/GG20xOSO).
   
    Umar Khan thanked for his work and shared he’s especially interested to know what you find, and share it with other folks at Gitcoin, hopefully we can spread some more insights, and opened the door to jam on some stuff and collaborate together.

Before wraping up the session, Carl launched the invitation to all who are going to be at ETH CC in Brussels next month, there is a little get together that we're putting on, and you can get register for that, and it’ll be talking all about "Grant Fuckups", so come and share all your stories: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of doing grants, and enjoy.


Stay tuned for more exciting updates as we continue to learn, share, and grow together in the Web3 ecosystem. 🚀

We had 31 atendees at the session
We had a quick presentation by Owocki about the restatement of Vision for regenlearning.xyz,  

Following Glen Weyl presented the Plurality book and shared the discord server where to join the movement (https://discord.gg/EQa2BjY8) started a 4 month and 6 continente tour starting on mid May, so if anyone want to get on the schedule for that tour you can write to Glen if there is something impactful to do, translations are a very important part of this (they already have 12 languages translations forks already running) the first translation fork is from a local publisher to Traditional Mandarin, as almost at the same time is in English, they are still looking for translation to a number of major languages including Hindi, Indonesian, Spanish, Hurdu, Arabic, Portuguese, etc. so there are a lot of opportunities for translations to different languages, just join their discord server where you can start contributing in this matter.

Sejal Rekhan shared their RPGF training program, what it looks like and how you can participate, the recent program that just concluded was the RPGF program and it was divided into 7 modules:
    - Module 1:  WTF is RetroPGF
    - Module 2:  Scoping your Retroactive Funding Round
    - Module 3:  Badgeholders, Understanding the Guardians
    - Module 4:  Application Process and Impact Evaluation Strategies
    - Module 5:  Nomination and Voting
    - Module 6:  Ops and Communication Strategy + KYC and payouts
    - Module 7:  Mastering EasyRetropgf tool
You go through the resources and access the whole training, it's live on Gitcoin Youtube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/@GitcoinOfficial, 
Sejal invites you to be part of the Pilot Cohort, that it's gonna be launched on April, 8th so they are planning to launch the applications for the communities who want to participate, the good thing about this training program is that you don¿t need to make everything 
by yourself because you will access a pool of people who have been through this training that will support you.  Here goes the form to apply: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnNn110IDn7lgFuUxHUTKT-UN782dh5FrmjnZjpLIOn3GfBw/viewform  , it will close soon so make sure to apply asap if interested tu run a pilot QF round for your community.
Also take note that being in a cohort you not only get the knowlege and the tools, but also they have this network effect because you will learn from each participant,  
There will be a wiki coming soon about best practices for you to have that resource at hand.

One last thing, there is a QF round focused on funding people that has made content and brought value about RPGFs, if you were in the cohort they recommend you to apply! Link for applications: https://ezrpgf-training.vercel.app/applications

Carl shared how was the experience for the first session on Regenlearning Data Bootcamp, it was organized on 3 groups: pandas, foxes, cheetas, every group has calls every 3 weeks, unfortunately it got affected by Eth Denver on the timing for new update sessions wich we hope to catch up soon.
Here goes some docs and useful links where you can make a contribution:
    - @fcarvaeth wants to do some Gitcoin climate-round analysis using the funding data (checkout: https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-funding)
    - @flow_science is interested in getting data flowing for NEAR projects 
    - @decentralizedceo is working on a grant proposal that includes community-led data analysis and would love some input from this group
    - @ccerv1 just released a huge bunch of docs for getting contributions to Open Source Observer (https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/contribute/). We're also getting some funding secured to reward "data challenges" — we hope to have the first data challenge posted     by this time next week!
Carl also shared the results of some data analysis already made about QF Grant Rounds, which is also open to receive any collaboration to make more analysis, add more data from other rounds and make this data set really interesting to analyse, here is the link to app:  https://ethereumgrantsdata.streamlit.app/

Then we heard pitches from 2 people due to time constraints.  Here is the list of pitches & pitch proposals:
    - [Geoweb] (https://geoweb.land/governance) for the live SQF pilot on Optimism Graven shared a new visualization tool for QF Rounds, real time metrics, they are looking to for more people to develop in this matter, check their work here:
