We had to reschedule our last meeting due to ETH Denver related commitments, but we're excited to reconvene and share a lot of updates from the group since then.

Agenda:
- Owocki: 
    - restatement of [vision for regenlearnings.xyz](https://regenlearnings.xyz/calls#purpose)
- Glen:
    - [Plurality Book](https://www.plurality.net/)
    - Follow and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/pluralitybook)
- Carl & Umar & David:
    - updates on data bootcamp & roadmap
    - opportunities for contributors
    - collaboration on the grant ecosystems sankey diagram
- Sejal:
    - program design trainings for QF and RPGF
    - how to get involved / run your own round
- 5 minute pitches: to be sourced & upvoted via Slido

We had 31 atendees at the session
We had a quick presentation by Owocki about the restatement of Vision for regenlearning.xyz,  

Following Glen Weyl presented the Plurality book and shared the discord server where to join the movement (https://discord.gg/EQa2BjY8) started a 4 month and 6 continente tour starting on mid May, so if anyone want to get on the schedule for that tour you can write to Glen if there is something impactful to do, translations are a very important part of this (they already have 12 languages translations forks already running) the first translation fork is from a local publisher to Traditional Mandarin, as almost at the same time is in English, they are still looking for translation to a number of major languages including Hindi, Indonesian, Spanish, Hurdu, Arabic, Portuguese, etc. so there are a lot of opportunities for translations to different languages, just join their discord server where you can start contributing in this matter.

Sejal Rekhan shared their RPGF training program, what it looks like and how you can participate, the recent program that just concluded was the RPGF program and it was divided into 7 modules:
    - Module 1:  WTF is RetroPGF
    - Module 2:  Scoping your Retroactive Funding Round
    - Module 3:  Badgeholders, Understanding the Guardians
    - Module 4:  Application Process and Impact Evaluation Strategies
    - Module 5:  Nomination and Voting
    - Module 6:  Ops and Communication Strategy + KYC and payouts
    - Module 7:  Mastering EasyRetropgf tool
You go through the resources and access the whole training, it's live on Gitcoin Youtube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/@GitcoinOfficial, 
Sejal invites you to be part of the Pilot Cohort, that it's gonna be launched on April, 8th so they are planning to launch the applications for the communities who want to participate, the good thing about this training program is that you don¿t need to make everything 
by yourself because you will access a pool of people who have been through this training that will support you.  Here goes the form to apply: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnNn110IDn7lgFuUxHUTKT-UN782dh5FrmjnZjpLIOn3GfBw/viewform  , it will close soon so make sure to apply asap if interested tu run a pilot QF round for your community.
Also take note that being in a cohort you not only get the knowlege and the tools, but also they have this network effect because you will learn from each participant,  
There will be a wiki coming soon about best practices for you to have that resource at hand.

One last thing, there is a QF round focused on funding people that has made content and brought value about RPGFs, if you were in the cohort they recommend you to apply! Link for applications: https://ezrpgf-training.vercel.app/applications

Carl shared how was the experience for the first session on Regenlearning Data Bootcamp, it was organized on 3 groups: pandas, foxes, cheetas, every group has calls every 3 weeks, unfortunately it got affected by Eth Denver on the timing for new update sessions wich we hope to catch up soon.
Here goes some docs and useful links where you can make a contribution:
    - @fcarvaeth wants to do some Gitcoin climate-round analysis using the funding data (checkout: https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-funding)
    - @flow_science is interested in getting data flowing for NEAR projects 
    - @decentralizedceo is working on a grant proposal that includes community-led data analysis and would love some input from this group
    - @ccerv1 just released a huge bunch of docs for getting contributions to Open Source Observer (https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/contribute/). We're also getting some funding secured to reward "data challenges" — we hope to have the first data challenge posted     by this time next week!
Carl also shared the results of some data analysis already made about QF Grant Rounds, which is also open to receive any collaboration to make more analysis, add more data from other rounds and make this data set really interesting to analyse, here is the link to app:  https://ethereumgrantsdata.streamlit.app/

Then we heard pitches from 2 people due to time constraints.  Here is the list of pitches & pitch proposals:
    - [Geoweb] (https://geoweb.land/governance) for the live SQF pilot on Optimism Graven shared a new visualization tool for QF Rounds, real time metrics, they are looking to for more people to develop in this matter, check their work here:         
    https://linktr.ee/streamingqf
    - [Team TE Academy] (https://gov.optimism.io/t/ai-copilots-for-optimism-retropgf/7636) data driven informed decission tool, looking for data scientists to access the beta LLMs and build tools together, here is what team TE Academy shared:  AI Copilots for Optimism      RetroPGFCTA:Please reach out via the RegenLearnings Telegram, user name is akrtws_TE_Academy
